# Project 1: Childhood lead poisoning 
Childhood lead poisoning is a serious health issue that can damage the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, learning and behavior problems and hearing and speech problems. In 2012, CDC established that a blood lead level of 5 mcg/dL is the reference level for exposure to lead in children. This level is used to identify children who have blood lead levels higher than most children's levels. Approximately half a million U.S. children ages 1-5 have blood lead levels above the blood lead value at which CDC recommends public health actions be initiated.
